# sentimentanalysis2019
This is a sentiment analysis project. The project fetches and imports Tweets from Twitter given certain parameters, parsed by the project developers. A sentiment analysis will then be performed on each individual Tweet, classifying the Tweet as either positive, negative or neutral. The gathered results will then be graphed and displayed on a web application, displaying proportion of each parameter's sentiment. This is particularly useful for marketing purposes as one may use the sentiment of a parameter for their particular line of business.
